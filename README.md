 RGB Javascript Game

this is my javascript game! ive made this game using the limited javascript knowledge, and i'm currently continuing to update it as i learn more and want to add new features!

this is my first project made using javascript, and im excited to learn more, improve, and see what my projects look like later on!

Things ive researched up during this process (everything else is from my brain):

Math.random()
.addEventLister
if statements
.replace
